		<article>It is a long established fact that a reader will be
			distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its
			layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less
			normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here,
			content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
			publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their
			default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many
			web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over
			the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected
			humour and the like).</article>
